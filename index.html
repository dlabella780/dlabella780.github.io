    <h1>Assignment 2a</h1>
    <p>For as long as I can remember, I used to be the kind of person who spurned the idea of <strong>"reading for fun."</strong> Despite being a gifted reader from a young age, I 
        would only ever read books that were required for school, and the occasional fiction series I'd taken a passing interest in. However, once I got into college 
        and I was no longer obligated to read, I <strong>all but completely stopped reading altogether.</strong> Recently, after I began to pursue self-improvement, I started
        finally understanding that mentality was flawed, and I'm now trying to rectify my past mistakes and make reading a regular habit in my life.

        The book I'm currently reading is a book on leadership by Brené Brown titled <strong><a href="https://brenebrown.com/book/dare-to-lead/" title="Dare to Lead - Brave Work. Tough Conversations. Whole Hearts." target="_blank">Dare to Lead</a></strong>,        which goes into detail about how having the courage to face things like emotion and vulnerability make for more powerful, compelling forms of leadership.
